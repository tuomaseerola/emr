        "This section is based on R template for analysing data from experiments and surveys and justification to follow certain conventions and structures. This document is available as a rendered html at [https://tuomaseerola.github.io/R_template/](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/R_template/).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Organisation\n",
        "\n",
        "For each project, you should establish one repository that you can clone/share using appropriate service (such as Github, Gitlab, or other services, even Dropbox works for collaborations). Name the repository with a compact but informative name (`chord_priming` or `emotion_recognition5`) that separates it from the potential other projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within this repository, it is a good idea to establish separate folders for separate elements:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `/data` Data in read-only format (preferably CSV or TSV format)\n",
        "* `/munge` All operations to pre-process, recode, or trim data\n",
        "* `/scr` All actual R scripts used in the analysis\n",
        "* `/figures` Outputs from the scripts (optional if use reporting languages)\n",
        "* `/docs` Outputs from the reports (optional if use reporting languages)\n",
        "\n",
        "In this repository, `contents.R` is the file that compiles the full analysis and allows you to reproduce evertyhing in R. Alternatively this file can Rmarkdown file, which is neat analysis and reporting format or even Quarto document, which is more advanced version of this. Nevertheless, the summary document contains all the stages, structures and processes of the project. This is structured to be executed in a coherent order and manner (i.e., loading, transforming, screening the data, and then visualising, applying statistical analyses, creating figures, and tables). \n",
        "\n",
        "`report.Rmd` will create the report that incorporates comments and the actual analyses and produces either html or pdf file (`report.html`, `report.pdf`) in the `docs` folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically the data is in CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) as this is the output from most experiment software solutions and also easily exported from _Qualtrics_, psychophysiological measures and so on. Sometimes the data might be in Excel format, which can also be read easily into R, and I would advice against large amount of edits in Excel as you would lose the ability to tell what has been changed and why. **The rule is that we never edit or manipulate or fix or alter the raw data**, no matter what the format is. \n",
        "\n",
        "It is good to store the raw original data with time stamps to the data folder and if you get a newer datasets or more observations, you add a new data file to the data folder with a new timestamp and keep the old one for reference. There are situations when the data has excess observations (pilot participants), typos and other issues, but it is easier and more transparent to handle these in the processing (munging) stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Munging\n",
        "\n",
        "Munging refers to preprocessing the raw data to be useful for the actual analysis. Often this means relabelling the names of the variables (columns) and possibly recoding the observations (as numeric responses or as factors). It is also very typical to pivot the data from wide format (numerous variables in columns) to long format so the key variables contain all manipulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Scripts\n",
        "\n",
        "Often you develop the analysis in stages, starting with some form of quality control and moving onto descriptives and then inferential statistics. For enhanced clarity and debugging, it is a good idea to develop these as separate scripts (and also possibly as functions) and store them in the scripts folder. The production of tables and figures can also be explicitly done with separate scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the end, you should have one file (that I call `contents.R`) that is able to produce the full analysis from reading the data, preprocessing the data, calculating quality control indicators, summarising the data, producing the analyses and creating tables and figures.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example repository and template analysis\n",
