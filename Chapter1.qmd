# Ch. 1 â€“ Notebook basics

This first notebook is just a demonstration of running R in notebook calculates the correlation between ratings of energy and tension from an existing dataset.

## Preliminaries

To install the `MusicScienceData` package that contains several example datasets used in this book, run the following command.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools",quiet=TRUE)
devtools::install_github("tuomaseerola/MusicScienceData",quiet=TRUE)
```

## Code 1.1

This is the first R code example, which demonstrates loading package that contains datasets, choosing one dataset, and then calculating correlation between two rated concepts (energy and tension).

```{r}
# Code 1.1
library(MusicScienceData)             # loads library w data
data <- MusicScienceData::soundtrack  # pick data
cor.test(data$Energy,                 # calc. correlation
         data$Tension)
```
