# Online Tutorials (R and Python)

## R

[An Introduction to R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html)
: The official guidance from _The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)_. May not be always the most compelling introduction but exhaustive at least.

[Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net)
: Really good source of R examples for almost all operations (manipulation, representation, functions, syntax, stats, figures, etc.).

[R tutorials](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/)
: Another fairly clear collection of tutorials.

[RStudio online learning pages](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/#R)
: [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com) is fancy and great visual GUI on top of the R for all platforms and they have released very useful documentations, tutorials, demos, etc.

[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz)
: Author of the best packages, Hadley Wickham, has created this resource (book and online version).

## Python
