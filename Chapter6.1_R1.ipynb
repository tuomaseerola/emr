    "There are plenty of tools for data analysis and statistics available. I will only consider those that are open source and free to use as this is the only way to guarantee that people are able to access the tools. Sadly some fine tools such as _SPSS_, _JMP_, _Minitab_, _SAS_, or _Stata_ don't fulfil these principles. _R_ and _RStudio_, _JASP_, _Jamovi_ and _Python_ (made better with libraries such as _scipy_) and some others are free and open source software that have become common research tools in empirical sciences. In addition to being free and easily available, they have excellent capacities to share the analysis workflow and some have tools to ensure replicability over years and different versions. I will focus on _R_ in the statistical analysis and explain why I think this is a good option for analysis empirical data."

    "\n",
    "R is a versatile environment for analysing any data. It is interactive and suits well for casual exploration of data that comes in many different forms (numbers, text strings) and different shapes (long and wide data). What is even more important in R is that it is fundamentally based on scripts that serve as a blueprint of the analysis you have done and allows you, or anyone else, to replicate your analyses simply by running the same script. R is also:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Free and open source.\n",
    "2. It works well on all operating systems: Windows, Mac Os, UNIX/Linux.\n",
    "3. the Community of R users is broad and active and for this reason the resources for learning and asking questions are impressive and well-developed (see Appendix).\n",
    "4. It already has several music-specific tools (e.g., `incon`,`gm`,`hrep` libraries) and datasets (`MusicScienceData`).\n",
    "5. It is excellent for any statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick tutorial for using R, but I would also recommend [Getting Started with R](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/201141096-Getting-Started-with-R) and [The Basics](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1) guides by the company who brings us RStudio ([Posit](https://posit.co/)).\n"

And since eighth note is a half of a quarter note, we expressed this as 0.5 and multiplied (* ) this with the tempo expression (60/120). You would get the same result with `1/2 * 60/120`.

    "\n",
    "_RStudio_ is a sleek and interactive _integrated development environment_ (IDE) that offers a number of great features to use R efficiently as it offers the console, and panes for folders, help files, an index of what it is the memory, and a separate window for plots.\n",

    "#### Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripts are a collection of commands that can be edited with a text editor and executed in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start a new script, you can click on _File_, then _New File_, then _R Script_. This starts a new pane on the left and it is here where you can start writing your script. This will contain your analysis. By documenting the analysis in the script, you, or anyone else, can replicate the steps in the script very easily and get the same results afterwards just by running the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running commands while editing scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "_RStudio_ helps to make the code more readable and easy to use by making different parts of the code in different colour and the indentation is automatically modified as you write the code. It will also close the parenthesis and suggest the variable names as you go along, and warn if a line of code contains an error. If we look at our new script, we first need to give it a name. A good practice is to name scripts in a descriptive fashion, use lower case letters, avoid spaces, only to use hyphens to separate words, and then followed by the suffix `.R`. We will call this script `Ch5_Ex01.R`. This one will grab data from a published dataset of emotions expressed by film soundtracks and plot the rated mean valence and energy of each track.\n",
