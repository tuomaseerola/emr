    "There are plenty of tools for data analysis and statistics available. I will only consider those that are open source and free to use as this is the only way to guarantee that people are able to access the tools. Sadly some fine tools such as _SPSS_, _JMP_, _Minitab_, _SAS_, or _Stata_ don't fulfil these principles. _R_ and _RStudio_, _JASP_, _Jamovi_ and _Python_ (made better with libraries such as _scipy_) and some others are free and open source software that have become common research tools in empirical sciences. In addition to being free and easily available, they have excellent capacities to share the analysis workflow and some have tools to ensure replicability over years and different versions. I will focus on _R_ in the statistical analysis and explain why I think this is a good option for analysis empirical data."
